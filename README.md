# Personal Health Information System

This web application was developed as part of our ITPM project to revolutionize the way personal health data is managed and protected in hospitals. The main objective is to ensure that patient records are completely secure and accessible only to the respective patient and hospital. Unlike traditional hospital management systems, our platform ensures that even system administrators cannot access sensitive patient data, upholding strict data privacy standards.
The system empowers patients by enabling them to upload clinic reports, lab results, and other health-related documents. These uploads can be analyzed to detect early signs of potential health risks, encouraging users to take preventive action before conditions worsen. By doing so, our platform promotes proactive healthcare management.
In addition, the platform supports seamless interaction between patients and hospitals while maintaining high data integrity. Through secure login credentials, users can manage their health history in a centralized, private, and user-friendly environment. The solution is designed with a strong focus on privacy, usability, and modern healthcare challenges.
